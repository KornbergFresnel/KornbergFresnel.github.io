Recently, my research interest in multi-agent learning lies in _diversity_. Excatlly, it is not a new concept in the machine learning community, but still an open question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this chapter, I'll introduce this concept from its development and the new progress around it.

MARL has been studied for many years, but its complexity and utility seems to go to the opposite direction. In the early stage, most of its downstream tasks do not involve a large number of agents and high-dimensional state and action spaces [add citation]. With the bomming of deep learning [add citation], it seems to bring researchers more confidence to apply MARL techniques to more practical tasks. But things go contrary to one's wishes.
